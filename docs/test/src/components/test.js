The COVID-19 virus cannot spread in areas sprayed with eucalyptus oil vapor., The results of another laboratory study suggest that a commercial blend of essential oils might help reduce the activity of one type of flu virus.," The results of another laboratory study suggest that a commercial blend of essential oils might help reduce the activity of one type of flu virus.

This product, sold as doTERRA On Guard , contains the essential oils of wild orange peel, clove bud, cinnamon leaf, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus leaves, and rosemary. However, these findings do not confirm that any essential oil can cure or treat flu or any other type of virus. For more information and resources to help keep you and your loved ones healthy this flu season, visit our dedicated hub . How to use The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not regulate essential oils or their use. For this reason, people should always buy them from reputable sources and use them with caution. There are two basic methods for using essential oils: application to the skin and inhalation. When applying an essential oil to the skin, always mix it with a carrier oil beforehand. Some examples of carrier oils include jojoba oil, olive oil, and nut oil. After diluting an essential oil, a person can apply it to the skin or add it to lotions and bath products. For inhalation therapy, float the essential oils in hot water and inhale the vapors, or use a room diffuser. Inhaling eucalyptus may help ease congestion. It is never safe to consume essential oils, and children should not use them in any way. It is best to ask a doctor before using essential oils for any medical purpose. Risks Just because essential oils are natural products, it does not mean that they are harmless. Like medication, they can cause severe side effects if a person uses them improperly or in excessive amounts. Some potential hazards associated with essential oils include: Irritation of the skin or mucous membrane: Infants, young children, older adults, and people with sensitive skin may be more likely to experience skin problems as a result of using essential oils. Poisoning: Never swallow an essential oil, as it may be toxic",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321401,524.1598510742188,15.490599632263184,newsreal_newsurl_content.csv,88992.0,9478.0,Verdict: False There is no scientific evidence that eucalyptus vapor can prevent people from contracting the new coronavirus.,1:58 PM 04/17/2020 Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show comments A post shared on Facebook claims that the COVID-19 virus cannot spread in areas sprayed with eucalyptus oil vapor.

How to use The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not regulate essential oils or their use. For this reason, people should always buy them from reputable sources and use them with caution. There are two basic methods for using essential oils: application to the skin and inhalation. When applying an essential oil to the skin, always mix it with a carrier oil beforehand. Some examples of carrier oils include jojoba oil, olive oil, and nut oil. After diluting an essential oil, a person can apply it to the skin or add it to lotions and bath products. For inhalation therapy, float the essential oils in hot water and inhale the vapors, or use a room diffuser. Inhaling eucalyptus may help ease congestion. It is never safe to consume essential oils, and children should not use them in any way. It is best to ask a doctor before using essential oils for any medical purpose. Risks Just because essential oils are natural products, it does not mean that they are harmless. Like medication, they can cause severe side effects if a person uses them improperly or in excessive amounts. Some potential hazards associated with essential oils include: Irritation of the skin or mucous membrane: Infants, young children, older adults, and people with sensitive skin may be more likely to experience skin problems as a result of using essential oils. Poisoning: Never swallow an essential oil, as it may be toxic",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321401,641.521728515625,15.490599632263184,newsreal_newsurl_content.csv,88994.0,9478.0,One post recently shared on Facebook claims that eucalyptus oil vapor can prevent its spread.,"Fact Check: Social media platforms have become replete with misinformation related to the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

Share on Pinterest A new study tracks the seasonality of human coronaviruses. A recent study by the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor tracked a group of participants over 8 years. The team looked in detail at the prevalence of the four most common human coronaviruses in the population. The research, which now appears in The Journal of Infectious Diseases , shines a light on an understudied aspect of coronaviruses and may prove valuable for scientists trying to make sense of the current pandemic. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. Coronaviruses old and new Over the past 20 years, researchers have primarily focused on a handful of coronaviruses that emerged from animals and transmitted to humans. These have typically resulted in more severe respiratory illnesses or posed a threat of pandemic, including SARS-CoV-1, which emerged in the early 2000s, and MERS-CoV, which emerged in 2012. SARS-CoV-2 also emerged from animals and transmitted to humans. However, coronaviruses have circulated in human populations for decades, and they tend to be associated with less severe illnesses.

Share on Pinterest A new study tracks the seasonality of human coronaviruses. A recent study by the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor tracked a group of participants over 8 years. The team looked in detail at the prevalence of the four most common human coronaviruses in the population. The research, which now appears in The Journal of Infectious Diseases , shines a light on an understudied aspect of coronaviruses and may prove valuable for scientists trying to make sense of the current pandemic. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. Coronaviruses old and new Over the past 20 years, researchers have primarily focused on a handful of coronaviruses that emerged from animals and transmitted to humans. These have typically resulted in more severe respiratory illnesses or posed a threat of pandemic, including SARS-CoV-1, which emerged in the early 2000s, and MERS-CoV, which emerged in 2012. SARS-CoV-2 also emerged from animals and transmitted to humans. However, coronaviruses have circulated in human populations for decades, and they tend to be associated with less severe illnesses. The researchers wanted to look in more detail at these older coronaviruses because they are relatively understudied compared with influenza, rhinoviruses, and other coronaviruses that have emerged in recent years. 8 years of data To do so, the team drew on data from a longitudinal study of households receiving primary care from the University of Michigan Health Care System",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/common-coronaviruses-appear-to-be-highly-seasonal,712.0328369140625,13.468999862670898,newsreal_newsurl_content.csv,129509.0,13851.0,"Usually, infections with these viruses are harmless ..","In the last two decades or so, though, researchers have found that these viruses can jump ...

Looking at BMI, researchers found that excess pounds did increase patients' risk of severe COVID-19 -- but only if they were young or middle-aged. Anderson said there are several reasons why obesity might worsen COVID-19 symptoms, starting with simple body mechanics. Continued ""If you have a big, obese belly, does that push up on your lungs and make it harder for you to expand your lungs?"" she said. Fat tissue also produces biochemicals known to promote inflammation and blood clotting -- two factors linked to more severe COVID-19 infection, Anderson added.

It also might be that other illnesses associated with obesity, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, contribute to COVID-19's impact on the body, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in Hewlett, N.Y. He said this study basically confirms what experts have suspected. ""Clearly every study has shown obesity potentially contributes to more severe illness, more intubations and even death,"" said Glatt, who wasn't part of the new research.

Mundell HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, April 21, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- A woman overcome by toxic fumes from her kitchen sink is rushed to the hospital; a toddler is treated in the ER after swallowing hand sanitizer. As Americans' obsession with disinfecting their homes against coronavirus rises, so are the number of poisoning emergencies like these, a new government report finds. ""Exposures to cleaners and disinfectants reported to NPDS [the National Poison Data System] increased substantially in early March 2020,"" noted a team led by Dr. Arthur Chang, a researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, there's been a more than 20% spike in the number of such poisoning emergencies reported to the NPDS, compared to the same time last year, the report found. While cleaning products and disinfectants can be toxic to germs, they can also prove toxic to people when mixed or used improperly, experts noted. ""While cleaning your home and your hands is important in reducing your risk for COVID-19, it's also important that you take the proper precautions to reduce a toxic exposure, which can lead to an ER visit,"" said emergency physician Dr. Robert Glatter, of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Bleach is one of the most common chemicals misused, the CDC team found, with improper use of bleach accounting ""for the largest percentage of the increase"" in household poisonings since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. In one case, ""an adult woman heard on the news to clean all recently purchased groceries before consuming them,"" Chang's group said. Going perhaps a little too far, ""she filled a sink with a mixture of 10% bleach solution, vinegar and hot water, and soaked her produce,"" the researchers said",https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200421/disinfectant-linked-poisoning-risea-amid-covid19,1130.78515625,9.79580020904541,newsreal_newsurl_content.csv,149806.0,16076.0,"Using information from the National Poison Data System (NPDS), the CDC said poison control centers received 45,550 calls for cleaners and disinfectants during January-March of this year, with 28,158 calls relating to cleaners and 17,392 to disinfectants.","The increase in calls was especially sharp during March, with the largest percentage of calls concerning children under 5, according to the CDC. Using information from the National Poison Data System (NPDS), the CDC said poison control centers received 45,550 calls for cleaners and disinfectants during January-March of this year, with 28,158 calls relating to cleaners and 17,392 to disinfectants. That represented an increase of 20.4% more calls than January-March 2019 and 16.4% more than January-March 2018."," The CDC believes the spike has happened because people are cleaning and disinfecting more during the coronavirus pandemic. The increase in calls was especially sharp during March, with the largest percentage of calls concerning children under 5, according to the CDC. Using information from the National Poison Data System (NPDS), the CDC said poison control centers received 45,550 calls for cleaners and disinfectants during January-March of this year, with 28,158 calls relating to cleaners and 17,392 to disinfectants. That represented an increase of 20.4% more calls than January-March 2019 and 16.4% more than January-March 2018. The NPDS didn’t present evidence linking the rise in calls to increased cleaning because of the pandemic, but the CDC said “there appears to be a clear temporal association.” “The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and disinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders,” the CDC said. The CDC provided two vignettes to show what kinds of calls the poison centers have been receiving. In one, a woman soaked her newly purchased produce in a sink filled with 10% bleach solution, vinegar, and hot water because she heard a news report saying newly purchased groceries should be cleaned. She had trouble breathing, went to a hospital, and was discharged after a few hours. In the second vignette, a preschool-aged child was found unresponsive with an open bottle of ethanol-based hand sanitizer on the kitchen table. The family said the child ingested the sanitizer, became dizzy, fell, and hit her head. She vomited on the way to the hospital, was admitted for 48 hours, and was discharged.

Paper Towels Beat Air Dryers Against Viruses,The bathrooms using jet air dryers were covered with more germs than those where only paper towel was used.,"Although there were differences between the hospitals, a consistent pattern did emerge. The bathrooms using jet air dryers were covered with more germs than those where only paper towel was used. “In effect, the dryer creates an aerosol that contaminates the toilet room, including the dryer itself and potentially the sinks, floor and other surfaces, depending on the dryer design and where it is sited,” said Wilcox, who supervised this study, in a statement .","” They also believe these findings are relevant to controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus that’s spreading worldwide, and that “paper towels should be the preferred way to dry hands after washing and so reduce the risk of virus contamination and spread.” Although it can be argued that this study was too small to firmly establish whether paper towels beat using a jet air dryer, this is only the latest study to discover the same thing. European study finds jet air dryers contaminate surfaces Scientists in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy teamed up for a study to settle the question of whether hand dryers or paper towels are best at preventing the spread of germs. For multiple 4-week periods, the scientists tracked how several bacteria known to cause disease in hospitals spread (like antibiotic-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) in multiple public bathrooms of several hospitals. Each of the bathrooms in the study had both paper towels and a jet air dryer installed. However, only one hand-drying method was allowed per bathroom. This allowed them to compare how each method performed within the same hospital. Although there were differences between the hospitals, a consistent pattern did emerge.

N95 Face Masks Could Be Sterilized and Re-Used,"The VHP-treated masks experienced no failures, suggesting they potentially could be re-used three times.","UV and heat-treated respirators began showing fit and seal problems after three decontaminations — suggesting these respirators potentially could be re-used twice. The VHP-treated masks experienced no failures, suggesting they potentially could be re-used three times. The authors concluded that VHP was the most effective decontamination method, because no virus could be detected after only a 10-minute treatment."," All four methods eliminated detectable viable virus from the N95 fabric test samples. The investigators then treated fully intact, clean respirators with the same decontamination methods to test their reuse durability. Volunteer RML employees wore the masks for two hours to determine if they maintained a proper fit and seal over the face; decontamination was repeated three times with each mask using the same procedure. The scientists found that ethanol spray damaged the integrity of the respirator’s fit and seal after two decontamination sessions and therefore do not recommend it for decontaminating N95 respirators.  UV and heat-treated respirators began showing fit and seal problems after three decontaminations — suggesting these respirators potentially could be re-used twice. The VHP-treated masks experienced no failures, suggesting they potentially could be re-used three times. The authors concluded that VHP was the most effective decontamination method, because no virus could be detected after only a 10-minute treatment. UV and dry heat were acceptable decontamination procedures as long as the methods are applied for at least 60 minutes. The authors urge anyone decontaminating an N95 respirator to check the fit and seal over the face before each re-use. Article R. Fischer, et al .

The WHO research also seeks to assess the value of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two antimalarial drugs, and to examine the effectiveness of two HIV drugs — ritonavir and lopinavir — used in combination. It is worth noting that another study has cast doubt on the efficacy of HIV antiretroviral therapies as a COVID-19 treatment. But it is also worth bearing in mind that participants in this study may have received the interventions too late. Lastly, in an attempt to boost the efficacy of the antiretrovirals, the WHO team will combine the two drugs with interferon beta, a first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis . The CDC recommend that all people wear cloth face masks in public places where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot distance from others. This will help slow the spread of the virus from asymptomatic people or people who do not know they have contracted the virus. Cloth face masks should be worn while continuing to practice physical distancing. Instructions for making masks at home can be found here . Note: It is critical that surgical masks and N95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers.

However, other studies indicate that tenofovir-based HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) does not provide protection against infection with the new coronavirus, nor does it ameliorate the course of COVID-19 disease [21]. In this study, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was actually higher among people taking PrEP compared to individuals who were not."," Based on available evidence, the use of LPV/r and other antiretrovirals are not likely to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. Several randomized and nonrandomized studies have evaluated anti-hepatitis C drugs including sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for treating of SARS-CoV-2 and while these preliminary results suggested benefit in terms of clinical recovery, this evidence is insufficient (small sample size, inclusion of a nonrandomized study) to be able to recommend using these antivirals for treating SARS-CoV-2. [20] Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection? A number of small studies have assessed whether antiretrovirals can be used to prevent infection from SARS-CoV2, often with discordant results. A recent study suggests that people living with HIV who were using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were less likely to contract SARS-CoV-2. However, other studies indicate that tenofovir-based HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) does not provide protection against infection with the new coronavirus, nor does it ameliorate the course of COVID-19 disease [21]. In this study, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was actually higher among people taking PrEP compared to individuals who were not. Taken together, the available literature does not provide conclusive evidence that antiretrovirals could protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection or from becoming seriously ill with the virus. However, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure. People taking PrEP or who are taking ARVs with the hopes of preventing COVID-19 need to adopt the same COVID-19 prevention measures as recommended for people in the general population",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-hiv-and-antiretrovirals,583.4586791992188,9.02810001373291,claims_urls_content.csv,54287.0,5729.0
