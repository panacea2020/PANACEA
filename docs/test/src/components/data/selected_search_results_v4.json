Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users have shared posts claiming Pelosi was in the central Chinese city of Wuhan six days after the Senate acquitted Trump on two articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, on Feb. 5. “Pelosi was in Wouhan ( sic ) China 6 days after the impeachment HOAX failed,” reads one such post. “Has anyone bothered to find out what she was doing there?” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Divert $2.4 billion From Social Security To Pay For Impeachment?) Had Pelosi traveled to China at that time, major media outlets would have reported on it, yet none did so. Members of Congress must also file expenditure reports for official foreign travel with the House Clerk’s office, and the foreign travel reports for the first quarter of 2020 show no record of Pelosi traveling to China. Pelosi made at least two public appearances in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 11, the day she was allegedly in China. She held a joint press conference with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and took photos with Democratic Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, according to press releases",

    "4": "To help extend the useful life of available equipment, researchers and hospitals are turning to a long-known, if little-used, means of disinfection -- ultraviolet radiation. \"It's generally well known that UV-C radiation kills microbes,\" said Bob Karlicek Jr., director of the Center for Lighting Enabled Systems and Applications at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. \"What's not known is the specific quantities of UV-C radiation that is required to fully disinfect complex equipment like N95 masks, because you have to get the light to the inside of the mask.\" Karlicek led a team that created a UV-C system designed to disinfect N95 masks. It's being tested at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. President Donald Trump was ridiculed last week after publicly speculating that UV light could be used to treat COVID-19 infection inside the human body. \"Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous -- whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light -- and I think you said that hasn't been checked, but you're going to test it,\" Trump said at a media briefing. \"And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you're going to test that, too. Sounds interesting.\" Experts quickly came forward to note that UV light can be harmful to humans, and that it would be impossible for ultraviolet rays to reach deep within the body to kill coronavirus in the lungs and other organs. That's also part of the problem with using UV light to disinfect protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves, Karlicek said. UV light disinfects by breaking down the genetic structure of coronaviruses and other microbes, he said",

    "4": "Flu Now Widespread in 45 States, What to Know Subscribe Health News Fact Checked Flu Taking a Toll, Pediatric Deaths Hit 17-Year High Written by Julia Ries on January 10, 2020 — Fact checked by Maria Gifford Share on Pinterest The flu is still spreading as we near peak flu season. Getty Images Northern and western states are now being hit hard. Currently the influenza B strain is appearing most often around the country. The CDC announced high numbers of pediatric deaths related to the flu. The United States may be gearing up for one of the worst flu seasons in years, health experts predict. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported Friday that there have been 32 pediatric deaths so far this season. That’s the most flu-related deaths we’ve seen in children since the CDC started tracking flu numbers 17 years ago . That’s the most flu-related deaths we’ve seen at this point in the season in years, though that’s largely due to the earlier start we got this year. (To put this into perspective, at this time last year, there had only been 16 pediatric deaths .) Most of the pediatric deaths have been linked to influenza B — a strain young children are particularly susceptible to. Now, influenza A appears to be gaining momentum, upping the risk that this flu season will be even more severe than expected. In total, there have been at least 9.7 million cases of the flu, at least 87,000 flu-related hospitalization, and up to 12,000 deaths, according to the CDC . Forty-six states plus Puerto Rico are currently experiencing widespread flu activity, though the type of strain and incidence vary from region to region. “Since mid-December, influenza activity has really ramped up,” said Marie-Louise Landry , MD, a Yale Medicine infectious disease expert and the director of the Yale Clinical Virology Laboratory",

    "16": "In other words, it really tilts the whole thing in your favor,” Schaffner said. When will it peak? In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season tends to peak between December and February.",
    "17": "These drugs are hardly a cure for the flu, and they’re only effective when taken shortly after the onset of flu symptoms. But they’re the best option available when it comes to lessening flu symptoms. Dr. William Schaffner , a professor of preventive medicine at the department of health policy and a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee, told Healthline that antiviral medications have the added benefit of lowering the risk of contagion. “They generally shorten the duration of the illness by a day, give or take, and very importantly, they make it less likely that you will transmit the flu to others because they’re killing the virus. They’re not letting it multiply,” he said. “You’re also less likely to get those serious complications of pneumonia and having to be hospitalized. In other words, it really tilts the whole thing in your favor,” Schaffner said. When will it peak? In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season tends to peak between December and February. But because every flu season is different, and contains a few surprises, it’s hard to predict when flu cases will peak or plateau. “You don’t know from year to year how early the peak will be — and we haven’t seen the peak yet this year — and how long it will last,” said Dr. Len Horovitz , an internist and pulmonary specialist in private practice in New York as well as on staff at Lenox Hill Hospital. “In 2009, the H1 strain came out in April and May.

However, the CDC recommendations emphasize that separation should be considered. \"To reduce the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 from the mother to the newborn, facilities should consider temporarily separating (eg, separate rooms) the mother who has confirmed COVID-19 or is a PUI [person under investigation] from her baby until the mother's transmission-based precautions are discontinued,\" the recommendations state. In addition, because the infant would have been exposed during birth, the recommendations continue, hospitals should consider housing the infant in a separate isolation room until he or she is no longer considered a PUI. But these actions may not be necessary, and newborns need to breast-feed frequently to establish breast-feeding habits and to benefit from everything it has to offer, another expert told Medscape Medical News . \"No Good Evidence\" \"People talk about antibodies in breast milk, but it's so much more than that,\" Anne Eglash, MD, IBCLC, clinical professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison and cofounder of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, told Medscape Medical News",

    "4": "However, tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes, bidis, cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth. Smoking waterpipes, also known as shisha or hookah, often involves the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in communal and social settings. As a smoker, am I likely to get more severe symptoms if infected? Smoking any kind of tobacco reduces lung capacity and increases the risk of many respiratory infections and can increase the severity of respiratory diseases. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other respiratory diseases.  Available research suggests that smokers are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and death. As a vaper, am I more likely to be infected or to have more severe symptoms if infected? There is no evidence about the relationship between e-cigarette use and COVID-19. However, existing evidence indicates that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS), more commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, are harmful and increase the risk of heart disease and lung disorders.  Given that the COVID-19 virus affects the respiratory tract, the hand-to-mouth action of e-cigarette use  may increase the risk of infection. What about using smokeless tobacco, like chewing tobacco? Using smokeless tobacco often involves some hand to mouth contact.  Another risk associated with using smokeless tobacco products, like chewing tobacco, is that the virus can be spread when the user spits out the excess saliva produced during the chewing process",

    "30": "researchers, who studied more than 4,000 COVID-19 patients in New York, reported in a preprint that they did not find “smoking status to be associated with increased risk of hospitalization or critical illness” [3] . However, one of the study’s weaknesses is that in their analysis, the researchers grouped never-smokers together with individuals whose history of smoking was unknown. It is not clear why these two populations were classified together and whether this may have influenced the results. While more studies are needed to establish a clear relationship between smoking and COVID-19 infection risk or severity, some preprints are beginning to shed more light on the subject. A preprint showing a meta-analysis by Patanavanich and Glantz suggests that smoking actually doubles the risk of severe COVID-19 infections [23] , while another study by Muus et al. also suggests that smoking worsens COVID-19 severity, correlating with broadened distribution of ACE2 in the lower respiratory tract [24] . And past studies clearly show that smoking increases the risk of respiratory infection and complications [20-22,25] . At the moment, there is little to no evidence indicating that these risks would be any different for COVID-19. Furthermore, smoking is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), which is a known risk factor for developing respiratory complications. The World Health Organization has clarified that smoking is likely to increase one’s risk for COVID-19 infection: “ Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) are in contact with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. Smokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness",

    "43": "In initial testing, experts have found that COVID-19 may result in mild symptoms for many people. Here are five expert-backed ways to prepare for a pandemic. Buy soap and disinfectants Health experts widely agree that frequent handwashing is the most effective way to avoid contracting COVID-19. So, the first thing to do is make sure you have a healthy supply of soap. “For preparation, I think the most important thing is to make sure they have enough soap — and that can be plain old bar soap to wash their hands on a regular basis,” said Dr. Michael Ison , an infectious disease physician and professor of infectious diseases and organ transplantation at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The virus may also be able to survive on surfaces for longer than a week, so disinfecting wipes can be useful. Some research shows bleach- and ethanol-based cleaning products may be the best at wiping out viruses on surfaces. You don’t need to stockpile disinfectants and hand sanitizers, Ison says, but have a bottle or two available. Stock up on supplies Experts say that if you’re healthy, you probably don’t need to buy face masks. For one, they’re not going to be very effective in preventing you from getting sick. Surgical masks are thin and have spaces through the sides where germs can easily get in. They’re mainly useful for people who are already sick to help limit how many respiratory droplets are shot into the air when they cough or sneeze. But if people keep buying the masks, there will continue to be shortages, and the individuals who actually need the masks — sick people and healthcare providers — won’t have them. What you do need is a couple weeks’ worth of food and supplies, according to the Department of Homeland Security",

You can follow these 10 steps to keep healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Keep to your regular routines as much as possible and maintain a daily schedule for yourself including sleeping, meals and activities. Stay socially connected . Speak to loved ones and people you trust every day or as much as possible, using the telephone, video-calls or messaging, through writing letters, etc. Use this time to share your feelings and to do common         hobbies together. Be physically active every day . Reduce long periods of sitting and set up a daily routine that includes at least 30 minutes of exercise. Make sure to do activities that are safe and appropriate for your level of physical fitness as         indicated by your health-care worker. You can use household chores as a way to keep physically active, follow an on-line class (e.g. Tai Chi, yoga) or choose your favourite music and dance to that. Drink water and eat healthy and well-balanced meals . This will keep you hydrated, help strengthen your immune system and lower the risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. For nutrition advice click here . Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol . Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 because smoking can affect lung capacity and because the act of smoking increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand         to mouth. Drinking alcohol not only disturbs your sleep but may also increase your risk of falls, weaken your immune system, and interact with any prescription medicines that you are taking. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or don’t         drink alcohol at all",

That said, there is no rule that says you need to lower a fever with over-the-counter medication if you’re feeling only mild symptoms and are not uncomfortable, Consumer Reports says in an article on COVID-19 and fevers. It lists a cold compress for sweating and blankets for chills, along with rest and liquids, as alternatives. The article says there is an argument for letting a fever run its course, because lowering a fever with medication might suppress your body’s ability to fend off illness, \"but if your fever is running at or above 103 degrees, you should call a doctor. A high fever could lead to a seizure or brain damage.\" Dr. Myron Cohen, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology, and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina and director of its Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases, told PolitiFact that while there is research suggesting that fever can defend against infection, \"it is extremely difficult to relate the magnitude of fever to the severity of infection, or to demonstrate the benefits of fever for any given microorganism,\" including the COVID-19 virus",

Getty Images Experts say there’s no clear evidence that ibuprofen makes COVID-19 worse. One thing specific to COVID-19 is that some lab experiments are showing that ibuprofen may boost the amount of ACE2 receptors that the virus uses to infect cells and could make the virus spread faster. But that’s just theoretical. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its stance on taking ibuprofen if you have COVID-19, but people are still scratching their heads over what they should take if or when they contract the virus. After previously announcing that people with the virus shouldn’t take ibuprofen to treat pain and fever, the WHO now says they don’t advise against it. The flip-flopping has a lot of people confused — especially those stocking up on medication in anticipation of getting the virus. Dr. Otto O. Yang , a professor of medicine in the infectious diseases division at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, told Healthline there’s no evidence that ibuprofen causes worsening of COVID-19, “although there is circulating misinformation to that effect",

The idea has been circulating on social media and also has been promoted to some degree by a few national governments . While there are some good reasons for certain patients to avoid NSAIDs generally, there is no evidence that ibuprofen — which is sold under the brand name Advil — or other similar drugs exacerbate the disease. Instead, the notion is simply a hypothesis that has not been tested. Much of the hubbub over ibuprofen appears to have started with comments from the French health minister, Olivier Véran, who said in a March 14 tweet that taking anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen “could be a factor in worsening the infection.” He advised people with fevers to take paracetamol , the European name for acetaminophen, or Tylenol, instead. He also suggested that people already taking anti-inflammatories should consult with their physicians.

Facebook post: In case you missed it, yesterday, Federal Agents arrested Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard University’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, with lying to the Department of Defense about secret monthly payments of $50,000.00 paid by China and receipt of millions more to help set up a chemical/biological “Research” laboratory in China.  Also arrested were two Chinese “Students” working as research assistants, one of whom was actually a lieutenant in the Chinese Army, the other captured at Logan Airport as he tried to catch a flight to China – smuggling 21 vials of “Sensitive Biological Samples” according to the FBI. Oh, almost forgot.  The research lab the good professor had helped set up? It’s located at the Wuhan University of Technology.  Wuhan China is ground zero to the potentially global pandemic known as the “Coronavirus”which is both spreading rapidly and killing people. This is Stephen Coonts international spy novel stuff happening in real life – and it has barely made the news. While each individual statement of the post is largely accurate, the main takeaway — that Lieber, possibly working with two students, had something to do with the new coronavirus  — is false. In fact, neither Lieber nor the two other individuals, each of whom were charged in separate cases in connection with aiding the People’s Republic of China, have any known link to the new virus.

    "82": " By Tom Kertscher • January 4, 2021 Great Game India goes on to claim that Chinese scientists working in the Canadian lab were \"bio-warfare agents\" and took the samples to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. One of the scientists mentioned in the Great Game India story, Xiangguo Qiu, is under investigation for a possible \"policy breach\" after she was invited to the Wuhan lab twice a year for two years. Qiu, her husband and her students from China were removed from the lab in July 2019. There are questions about what information Qiu shared with Chinese officials while visiting Wuhan, and the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory has sent viruses to China in the past for research. But there is no evidence to support the claim that Qiu stole coronavirus samples and gave them to the Wuhan lab to create biological weapons. The Wuhan lab The assertion that the origin of the coronavirus outbreak is a Chinese lab near Wuhan also lacks evidence. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world’s most dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and the SARS coronavirus. Some experts have linked the lab to China’s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the State Department has raised concerns about China’s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons. \"Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus,\" the Great Game India story reads. As of now, however, the lab’s proximity to the seafood market is a coincidence, as there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the coronavirus outbreak",

Facebook post: In case you missed it, yesterday, Federal Agents arrested Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard University’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, with lying to the Department of Defense about secret monthly payments of $50,000.00 paid by China and receipt of millions more to help set up a chemical/biological “Research” laboratory in China.  Also arrested were two Chinese “Students” working as research assistants, one of whom was actually a lieutenant in the Chinese Army, the other captured at Logan Airport as he tried to catch a flight to China – smuggling 21 vials of “Sensitive Biological Samples” according to the FBI. Oh, almost forgot.  The research lab the good professor had helped set up? It’s located at the Wuhan University of Technology.  Wuhan China is ground zero to the potentially global pandemic known as the “Coronavirus”which is both spreading rapidly and killing people. This is Stephen Coonts international spy novel stuff happening in real life – and it has barely made the news. While each individual statement of the post is largely accurate, the main takeaway — that Lieber, possibly working with two students, had something to do with the new coronavirus  — is false. In fact, neither Lieber nor the two other individuals, each of whom were charged in separate cases in connection with aiding the People’s Republic of China, have any known link to the new virus. And as we have written before , there is no evidence that the novel coronavirus was engineered in a lab. What Happened With Lieber On Jan",
