Verdict: False India’s government has debunked the rumor. There is no record of Ravi Nayak working at the Ministry of Home Affairs. Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users have shared posts claiming India’s Ministry of Home Affairs recently announced that only government agencies can post about the new coronavirus on social media. The Facebook posts attribute the announcement to Nayak, who allegedly works as the “principal secretary” in the Ministry of Home Affairs. “All honorable members of the group are informed that right now any post related to Corona virus has been declared a punishable offense by the Central Government, only a government agency can post on Corona,” reads one such post. “In case of wrong post or message, action will be taken against the members of the entire group including the group administrator by registering a lawsuit under the IT Act, so keep in mind be safe!” India’s Press Information Bureau debunked the message in a tweet on March 30. (RELATED: Is India The World’s Oldest Democracy?) No such order has been issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pitched Senate Republicans on a stimulus package that would include an initial $250 billion for direct payments, according to administration officials and lawmakers, part of a wide-ranging fiscal and monetary effort. One of the officials said the administration would push for additional direct payments beyond the $250 billion in the coming weeks, if needed. \"It is a big number. We've put a proposal on the table that would inject a trillion dollars into the economy,\" Mr. Mnuchin told reporters at the Capitol. While it appears likely that Americans will see a cash infusion of some amount, this Facebook post is made up. Trump is not threatening to selectively send checks based on people's political leanings as they appear on social media, with particular exceptions for those who criticize the president with the hashtag #NotMyPresident",

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False While Democratic senators voted against moving the bill forward in earlier procedural votes over policy concerns, the Senate passed the final version unanimously. Fact Check: The image displays the names of 44 senators, all Democrats except for Independent Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, alleging they “voted NOT to send stimulus checks.” President Donald Trump signed into law on March 27 a $2.2 trillion dollar stimulus package aimed at softening the economic blow of the coronavirus pandemic. That economic stimulus package included $300 billion in direct payments to American taxpayers. However, the post’s claim is inaccurate. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate on March 25, The New York Times reported . Whoever created the meme likely mistook one of the earlier procedural votes on the stimulus package as the final vote. In the days before the final vote, the Senate was roughly divided along party lines over some appropriations in the bill. Among the sticking points were oversight on the $500 billion earmarked for distressed corporations, worker protections and unemployment insurance, per CNBC . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the $500 billion fund as a “giant corporate bailout fund with no accountability – you wouldn’t even know what loans were made until six months later,” according to Vox . In a 47-47 cloture vote on March 22, the Senate failed to get the 60 votes necessary to move the bill forward, with all 45 of the Senate Democrats voting against the motion",

This product, sold as doTERRA On Guard , contains the essential oils of wild orange peel, clove bud, cinnamon leaf, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus leaves, and rosemary. However, these findings do not confirm that any essential oil can cure or treat flu or any other type of virus. For more information and resources to help keep you and your loved ones healthy this flu season, visit our dedicated hub . How to use The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not regulate essential oils or their use. For this reason, people should always buy them from reputable sources and use them with caution. There are two basic methods for using essential oils: application to the skin and inhalation. When applying an essential oil to the skin, always mix it with a carrier oil beforehand. Some examples of carrier oils include jojoba oil, olive oil, and nut oil. After diluting an essential oil, a person can apply it to the skin or add it to lotions and bath products. For inhalation therapy, float the essential oils in hot water and inhale the vapors, or use a room diffuser. Inhaling eucalyptus may help ease congestion. It is never safe to consume essential oils, and children should not use them in any way. It is best to ask a doctor before using essential oils for any medical purpose. Risks Just because essential oils are natural products, it does not mean that they are harmless. Like medication, they can cause severe side effects if a person uses them improperly or in excessive amounts. Some potential hazards associated with essential oils include: Irritation of the skin or mucous membrane: Infants, young children, older adults, and people with sensitive skin may be more likely to experience skin problems as a result of using essential oils. Poisoning: Never swallow an essential oil, as it may be toxic",

Verdict: False There is no scientific evidence that eucalyptus vapor can prevent people from contracting the new coronavirus. No mention of such research appears on the University of Havana website. Fact Check: Social media platforms have become replete with misinformation related to the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. One post recently shared on Facebook claims that eucalyptus oil vapor can prevent its spread. “Doctors of the University of Havana – Cuba confirmed and demonstrated that COVID-19 does not develop in environments where 1,8 Epoxy-p-methane is used, which is the antiviral, antiseptic and Eucalyptol bactericide better know as Eucalyptus in a series of tests in environments sprayed with hot Eucalyptol vapor,” claims the post. “Due to the heat of the vapor generated by the vapors, they recommend having branches of eucalyptus in the rooms, or vapors with eucalyptus oil or branches thereof to avoid COVID-19.” Eucalyptus is a type of tree native to Australia, and its leaves are often touted online for having medicinal properties. (RELATED: Does Sunlight Kill Coronavirus?) No news reporting or scientific research could be found to corroborate the post’s claim, however. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization do not list eucalyptus as an effective preventative or treatment for COVID-19 anywhere on their respective websites.

      "64": "The results of another laboratory study suggest that a commercial blend of essential oils might help reduce the activity of one type of flu virus. This product, sold as doTERRA On Guard , contains the essential oils of wild orange peel, clove bud, cinnamon leaf, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus leaves, and rosemary. However, these findings do not confirm that any essential oil can cure or treat flu or any other type of virus. For more information and resources to help keep you and your loved ones healthy this flu season, visit our dedicated hub . How to use The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not regulate essential oils or their use. For this reason, people should always buy them from reputable sources and use them with caution. There are two basic methods for using essential oils: application to the skin and inhalation. When applying an essential oil to the skin, always mix it with a carrier oil beforehand. Some examples of carrier oils include jojoba oil, olive oil, and nut oil. After diluting an essential oil, a person can apply it to the skin or add it to lotions and bath products. For inhalation therapy, float the essential oils in hot water and inhale the vapors, or use a room diffuser. Inhaling eucalyptus may help ease congestion. It is never safe to consume essential oils, and children should not use them in any way. It is best to ask a doctor before using essential oils for any medical purpose. Risks Just because essential oils are natural products, it does not mean that they are harmless. Like medication, they can cause severe side effects if a person uses them improperly or in excessive amounts. Some potential hazards associated with essential oils include: Irritation of the skin or mucous membrane: Infants, young children, older adults, and people with sensitive skin may be more likely to experience skin problems as a result of using essential oils. Poisoning: Never swallow an essential oil, as it may be toxic",

As of April 2, nearly 10 million people had filed for unemployment insurance. But getting fired for cause — as opposed to being laid off or furloughed — can jeopardize workers’ ability to collect benefits . And a recent Facebook post suggests that Goodwill exploited shelter-in-place orders to fire its employees instead of merely laying them off. \"I just want to share what Goodwill Industries just did to all their employees,\" begins the April 2 Facebook post . \"They use this pandemic to fire all their employees instead of laying them off.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook .) Lauren Lawson-Zilai, a spokesperson for Goodwill Industries International, told PolitiFact that each of the 157 Goodwill organizations in the United States and Canada is a locally operated nonprofit with its own president and CEO. More than 96% of Goodwill’s thrift stores have closed because of state regulations in response to the spread of COVID-19, she said. But she said the Facebook post doesn’t appear to be accurate. \"Some Goodwill organizations have had to furlough their employees,\" she said. \"These employees are receiving benefits\" that vary state by state. Other Goodwill operations are ongoing in some capacity, she said. For example, 90% of Goodwills are operating business services",

NYC was facing a hospital budget crisis and you fixed it for them. They are inflating all of their #coronavirus numbers. This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing: The post claims that within the $2.2 trillion stimulus package, hospitals are receiving a huge increase in the money they're given per COVID-19 patients. In response, according to the post, hospitals are reporting larger numbers of coronavirus patients to further boost their funding. This is misleading. There is language in the bill that says hospitals will be compensated 15% more for COVID-19 patients, but there is no evidence to prove that NYC hospitals are inflating their numbers",
