This product, sold as doTERRA On Guard , contains the essential oils of wild orange peel, clove bud, cinnamon leaf, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus leaves, and rosemary. However, these findings do not confirm that any essential oil can cure or treat flu or any other type of virus. For more information and resources to help keep you and your loved ones healthy this flu season, visit our dedicated hub . How to use The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not regulate essential oils or their use. For this reason, people should always buy them from reputable sources and use them with caution. There are two basic methods for using essential oils: application to the skin and inhalation. When applying an essential oil to the skin, always mix it with a carrier oil beforehand. Some examples of carrier oils include jojoba oil, olive oil, and nut oil. After diluting an essential oil, a person can apply it to the skin or add it to lotions and bath products. For inhalation therapy, float the essential oils in hot water and inhale the vapors, or use a room diffuser. Inhaling eucalyptus may help ease congestion. It is never safe to consume essential oils, and children should not use them in any way. It is best to ask a doctor before using essential oils for any medical purpose. Risks Just because essential oils are natural products, it does not mean that they are harmless. Like medication, they can cause severe side effects if a person uses them improperly or in excessive amounts. Some potential hazards associated with essential oils include: Irritation of the skin or mucous membrane: Infants, young children, older adults, and people with sensitive skin may be more likely to experience skin problems as a result of using essential oils. Poisoning: Never swallow an essential oil, as it may be toxic",

One post recently shared on Facebook claims that eucalyptus oil vapor can prevent its spread. “Doctors of the University of Havana – Cuba confirmed and demonstrated that COVID-19 does not develop in environments where 1,8 Epoxy-p-methane is used, which is the antiviral, antiseptic and Eucalyptol bactericide better know as Eucalyptus in a series of tests in environments sprayed with hot Eucalyptol vapor,” claims the post. “Due to the heat of the vapor generated by the vapors, they recommend having branches of eucalyptus in the rooms, or vapors with eucalyptus oil or branches thereof to avoid COVID-19.” Eucalyptus is a type of tree native to Australia, and its leaves are often touted online for having medicinal properties. (RELATED: Does Sunlight Kill Coronavirus?) No news reporting or scientific research could be found to corroborate the post’s claim, however. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization do not list eucalyptus as an effective preventative or treatment for COVID-19 anywhere on their respective websites.

      "48": "The results of another laboratory study suggest that a commercial blend of essential oils might help reduce the activity of one type of flu virus. This product, sold as doTERRA On Guard , contains the essential oils of wild orange peel, clove bud, cinnamon leaf, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus leaves, and rosemary. However, these findings do not confirm that any essential oil can cure or treat flu or any other type of virus. For more information and resources to help keep you and your loved ones healthy this flu season, visit our dedicated hub . How to use The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not regulate essential oils or their use. For this reason, people should always buy them from reputable sources and use them with caution. There are two basic methods for using essential oils: application to the skin and inhalation. When applying an essential oil to the skin, always mix it with a carrier oil beforehand. Some examples of carrier oils include jojoba oil, olive oil, and nut oil. After diluting an essential oil, a person can apply it to the skin or add it to lotions and bath products. For inhalation therapy, float the essential oils in hot water and inhale the vapors, or use a room diffuser. Inhaling eucalyptus may help ease congestion. It is never safe to consume essential oils, and children should not use them in any way. It is best to ask a doctor before using essential oils for any medical purpose. Risks Just because essential oils are natural products, it does not mean that they are harmless. Like medication, they can cause severe side effects if a person uses them improperly or in excessive amounts. Some potential hazards associated with essential oils include: Irritation of the skin or mucous membrane: Infants, young children, older adults, and people with sensitive skin may be more likely to experience skin problems as a result of using essential oils. Poisoning: Never swallow an essential oil, as it may be toxic",

Searching for more information about robbers handing out compromised face masks, however, we found no other news stories covering such reports. We did find several fact-checks from news organizations debunking the claim. Certainly, there is criminal activity connected to face masks. The New York Post reported on April 8 that a businessman is accused of stealing and selling about 2 million masks. A New York Times story about \"coronavirus bandits\" details two armed robbers who stole as much as $270,000 from a racetrack in Queens wearing surgical masks. CNBC says people are stealing masks from doctors’ offices over coronavirus fears. Common sense advice would be not to try on masks offered by strangers.

No, that's not true: Internet users are sharing an original infographic that has been altered to claim that most of the world's deadliest pandemics can be traced back to China. However, some of the outbreaks did not actually derive from that country. The claim appeared in a post (archived here ) published on Twitter by @SHARKSURVIVOR1 on April 11, 2020. It opened: Look at this image: FIFTEEN pandemics have originated in China. Are they releasing these on purpose, or are all of these deadly agents coming from their filthy third world Petri dish wet markets? This is what the post looked like on Twitter at the time of writing: The original infographic was published online by Visual Capitalist , a site that creates data-driven visuals to tell stories. However, another Internet user applied computer drawing tools over the original graphic to add circles along with the caption, \"O=Originated in China.\" The new claim is that 15 of the deadliest pandemics in world history started in China. This is not entirely true. Lead Stories will break down each outbreak that was circled on the graphic: Black Death (Bubonic Plague) - Originally thought to have originated in China, ancient DNA testing has traced the inception to Russia's Volga region, according to the journal Science . Smallpox - \"Smallpox is thought to have originated in India or Egypt at least 3,000 years ago,\" National Geographic reported. Spanish Flu - A misnomer for the 1918 influenza pandemic because it is not believed to have originated in the Iberian peninsula",

According to All India Radio on March 31, 2020: The research report referred to in the Journal of Virology & Anti viral Research is related to a completely different coronavirus - Mouse Hepatitis Virus Type-4 or MHV-4 & not COVID-19. The report was published way back in 1991. People are desperate for hope during the coronavirus outbreak, and online claims touting this diet are going viral. But this is not an effective preventative measure in fighting off the virus responsible for more than 51,700 deaths globally. In the U.S. alone, some 5,100 people have died. The post, with more than 300 shares, had commenters claiming they were following the diet and others noting the advice was bogus. In fact, there is no published, medical proof that this diet could keep someone from becoming ill with, or dying from, COVID-19. Africa Check, a fact-checking site, debunked the claim on March 25, 2020. And Reuters addressed a similar claim on March 10, 2020, confirming with the World Health Organization that there are no treatments - no cure and no available vaccine - yet for COVID-19. \"There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 and treatment is based on clinical presentation. Most cases are mild and self-limiting, and treated symptomatically,\" a WHO spokesperson told Reuters. The false claim may have originated in online theories that alkaline diets help prevent cancer. Lead Stories has also debunked that claim. In a story we published in 2019 , medical experts denied the connection between a diet high in alkaline foods and a cure for cancer",

      "57": "And even though there is a Journal of Virology and Antiviral Research, there appears to be no such study in there proving up alkaline diets in the fight against COVID-19. According to All India Radio on March 31, 2020: The research report referred to in the Journal of Virology & Anti viral Research is related to a completely different coronavirus - Mouse Hepatitis Virus Type-4 or MHV-4 & not COVID-19. The report was published way back in 1991. People are desperate for hope during the coronavirus outbreak, and online claims touting this diet are going viral. But this is not an effective preventative measure in fighting off the virus responsible for more than 51,700 deaths globally. In the U.S. alone, some 5,100 people have died. The post, with more than 300 shares, had commenters claiming they were following the diet and others noting the advice was bogus. In fact, there is no published, medical proof that this diet could keep someone from becoming ill with, or dying from, COVID-19. Africa Check, a fact-checking site, debunked the claim on March 25, 2020. And Reuters addressed a similar claim on March 10, 2020, confirming with the World Health Organization that there are no treatments - no cure and no available vaccine - yet for COVID-19. \"There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 and treatment is based on clinical presentation. Most cases are mild and self-limiting, and treated symptomatically,\" a WHO spokesperson told Reuters. The false claim may have originated in online theories that alkaline diets help prevent cancer. Lead Stories has also debunked that claim. In a story we published in 2019 , medical experts denied the connection between a diet high in alkaline foods and a cure for cancer",

Some believe that changing the body's pH levels can improve your health and help you lose weight or even prevent cancer. But there's no way the foods you eat can alter the pH level of your blood. The body's pH is a very tightly regulated system. If you change your diet, you may see changes in the pH of your saliva or urine because these are waste products, but there's no way you could ever eat enough that it really impacts your blood.\" The is no proof to the theory that the alkaline diet would prevent coronavirus (and cancer) despite the viral stories. On Facebook, dietician Julie Perk reiterated that the diet does not prevent coronavirus.

      "75": "On average, they were hospitalized for one week, researchers found. Looking at BMI, researchers found that excess pounds did increase patients' risk of severe COVID-19 -- but only if they were young or middle-aged. Anderson said there are several reasons why obesity might worsen COVID-19 symptoms, starting with simple body mechanics. Continued \"If you have a big, obese belly, does that push up on your lungs and make it harder for you to expand your lungs?\" she said. Fat tissue also produces biochemicals known to promote inflammation and blood clotting -- two factors linked to more severe COVID-19 infection, Anderson added. \"Fat tissue doesn't just sit there and store fat,\" she said. \"It also does lots of other things that can influence your health.\" It also might be that other illnesses associated with obesity, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, contribute to COVID-19's impact on the body, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in Hewlett, N.Y. He said this study basically confirms what experts have suspected. \"Clearly every study has shown obesity potentially contributes to more severe illness, more intubations and even death,\" said Glatt, who wasn't part of the new research. Based on the evidence, folks who are obese might want to hew even more closely to social distancing and other methods of protecting themselves against infection, Anderson said. \"It's important for doctors and patients to really think about how long they should prolong social distancing, whether they should continue to try to avoid contact until the pandemic is under better control,\" she said. \"People who are obese and young may want to consider prolonged social distancing and minimizing risks for a little longer than people who are not obese.\" Glatt agreed",

Where obesity rates are so high and also among young people. Jay Butler: Sure, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify a bit.  So, we’re really talking about the strength of evidence, rather than the downgrading or upgrading the level of risk.  The question of hypertension is one that came up very early on, even as we were receiving some of the early data out of china.  I think what we’ve been able to do, as more data become available, recognizing that hypertension is a risk factor for other diseases, such as heart disease, chronic kidney failure, we’ve been able to tease apart a little bit more how much just having hypertension alone, as opposed to having some of those end-organ manifestations of hypertension, may be driving the increased risk.

The increase in calls was especially sharp during March, with the largest percentage of calls concerning children under 5, according to the CDC. Using information from the National Poison Data System (NPDS), the CDC said poison control centers received 45,550 calls for cleaners and disinfectants during January-March of this year, with 28,158 calls relating to cleaners and 17,392 to disinfectants. That represented an increase of 20.4% more calls than January-March 2019 and 16.4% more than January-March 2018. The NPDS didn’t present evidence linking the rise in calls to increased cleaning because of the pandemic, but the CDC said “there appears to be a clear temporal association.” “The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and disinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders,” the CDC said. The CDC provided two vignettes to show what kinds of calls the poison centers have been receiving. In one, a woman soaked her newly purchased produce in a sink filled with 10% bleach solution, vinegar, and hot water because she heard a news report saying newly purchased groceries should be cleaned. She had trouble breathing, went to a hospital, and was discharged after a few hours. In the second vignette, a preschool-aged child was found unresponsive with an open bottle of ethanol-based hand sanitizer on the kitchen table.

As Americans' obsession with disinfecting their homes against coronavirus rises, so are the number of poisoning emergencies like these, a new government report finds. \"Exposures to cleaners and disinfectants reported to NPDS [the National Poison Data System] increased substantially in early March 2020,\" noted a team led by Dr. Arthur Chang, a researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, there's been a more than 20% spike in the number of such poisoning emergencies reported to the NPDS, compared to the same time last year, the report found. While cleaning products and disinfectants can be toxic to germs, they can also prove toxic to people when mixed or used improperly, experts noted. \"While cleaning your home and your hands is important in reducing your risk for COVID-19, it's also important that you take the proper precautions to reduce a toxic exposure, which can lead to an ER visit,\" said emergency physician Dr. Robert Glatter, of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Bleach is one of the most common chemicals misused, the CDC team found, with improper use of bleach accounting \"for the largest percentage of the increase\" in household poisonings since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. In one case, \"an adult woman heard on the news to clean all recently purchased groceries before consuming them,\" Chang's group said. Going perhaps a little too far, \"she filled a sink with a mixture of 10% bleach solution, vinegar and hot water, and soaked her produce,\" the researchers said",

That represented an increase of 20.4% more calls than January-March 2019 and 16.4% more than January-March 2018.",
      "84": "The CDC believes the spike has happened because people are cleaning and disinfecting more during the coronavirus pandemic. The increase in calls was especially sharp during March, with the largest percentage of calls concerning children under 5, according to the CDC. Using information from the National Poison Data System (NPDS), the CDC said poison control centers received 45,550 calls for cleaners and disinfectants during January-March of this year, with 28,158 calls relating to cleaners and 17,392 to disinfectants. That represented an increase of 20.4% more calls than January-March 2019 and 16.4% more than January-March 2018. The NPDS didn’t present evidence linking the rise in calls to increased cleaning because of the pandemic, but the CDC said “there appears to be a clear temporal association.” “The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and disinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders,” the CDC said. The CDC provided two vignettes to show what kinds of calls the poison centers have been receiving. In one, a woman soaked her newly purchased produce in a sink filled with 10% bleach solution, vinegar, and hot water because she heard a news report saying newly purchased groceries should be cleaned. She had trouble breathing, went to a hospital, and was discharged after a few hours. In the second vignette, a preschool-aged child was found unresponsive with an open bottle of ethanol-based hand sanitizer on the kitchen table. The family said the child ingested the sanitizer, became dizzy, fell, and hit her head. She vomited on the way to the hospital, was admitted for 48 hours, and was discharged. The most recent NPDS bulletin showed findings with similar incidents",

Each of the bathrooms in the study had both paper towels and a jet air dryer installed. However, only one hand-drying method was allowed per bathroom.

The findings indicate there was fivefold more virus dispersed to clothing. Surface contamination was more than 10 times higher after jet air dryer use compared with hand-drying by paper towel. According to researchers, this means microbes can’t only be transferred directly from hands that are still contaminated after hand-drying, but also indirectly from that person’s body, which was contaminated by viruses blown by the jet air dryer blast. “Crucially, these differences in contamination translate into significantly greater levels of microbe contamination after jet air drying versus paper towel use from hands and body beyond the toilet/washroom,” the study authors wrote. “As public toilets are used by patients, visitors and staff, the hand drying method chosen has the potential to increase (using jet dryers) or reduce (using paper towels) pathogen transmission in hospital settings",

The findings indicate there was fivefold more virus dispersed to clothing. Surface contamination was more than 10 times higher after jet air dryer use compared with hand-drying by paper towel. According to researchers, this means microbes can’t only be transferred directly from hands that are still contaminated after hand-drying, but also indirectly from that person’s body, which was contaminated by viruses blown by the jet air dryer blast. “Crucially, these differences in contamination translate into significantly greater levels of microbe contamination after jet air drying versus paper towel use from hands and body beyond the toilet/washroom,” the study authors wrote. “As public toilets are used by patients, visitors and staff, the hand drying method chosen has the potential to increase (using jet dryers) or reduce (using paper towels) pathogen transmission in hospital settings",

Several randomized and nonrandomized studies have evaluated anti-hepatitis C drugs including sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for treating of SARS-CoV-2 and while these preliminary results suggested benefit in terms of clinical recovery, this evidence is insufficient (small sample size, inclusion of a nonrandomized study) to be able to recommend using these antivirals for treating SARS-CoV-2. [20] Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection? A number of small studies have assessed whether antiretrovirals can be used to prevent infection from SARS-CoV2, often with discordant results. A recent study suggests that people living with HIV who were using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were less likely to contract SARS-CoV-2. However, other studies indicate that tenofovir-based HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) does not provide protection against infection with the new coronavirus, nor does it ameliorate the course of COVID-19 disease [21]. In this study, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was actually higher among people taking PrEP compared to individuals who were not. Taken together, the available literature does not provide conclusive evidence that antiretrovirals could protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection or from becoming seriously ill with the virus. However, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure. People taking PrEP or who are taking ARVs with the hopes of preventing COVID-19 need to adopt the same COVID-19 prevention measures as recommended for people in the general population",

[20] Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection? A number of small studies have assessed whether antiretrovirals can be used to prevent infection from SARS-CoV2, often with discordant results. A recent study suggests that people living with HIV who were using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were less likely to contract SARS-CoV-2. However, other studies indicate that tenofovir-based HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) does not provide protection against infection with the new coronavirus, nor does it ameliorate the course of COVID-19 disease [21]. In this study, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was actually higher among people taking PrEP compared to individuals who were not. Taken together, the available literature does not provide conclusive evidence that antiretrovirals could protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection or from becoming seriously ill with the virus. However, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure. People taking PrEP or who are taking ARVs with the hopes of preventing COVID-19 need to adopt the same COVID-19 prevention measures as recommended for people in the general population",

Researchers are keen to investigate the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 because earlier work has shown that it might reduce the risk of some respiratory infections that are entirely unrelated to TB.

      "21": "What is the BCG vaccination? The BCG vaccine protects against TB, an infectious disease that most commonly affects the lungs. A bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis is what causes TB. The BCG vaccine reduces the chances of the bacterium infecting someone. It also reduces the severity of the disease in those who do contract it. The BCG vaccine first became available in 1921, and it appears on the World Health Organization (WHO) List of Essential Medicines. In excess of 100 million babies receive the BCG vaccination each year. Aside from TB, the BCG vaccine also protects against other conditions that involve mycobacterium, including leprosy. Scientists produce the vaccine using live Mycobacterium bovis taken from bovines, which they have attenuated to reduce their virility. Why might BCG work against COVID-19? Researchers are keen to investigate the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 because earlier work has shown that it might reduce the risk of some respiratory infections that are entirely unrelated to TB. For instance, a study that scientists conducted in Guinea-Bissau concluded that “BCG vaccination may have a nontargeted protective effect against [acute lower respiratory tract infection], the effect being most marked in girls.” In another study , researchers delved into retrospective data from Spanish hospitals. They concluded that “BCG vaccination at birth may decrease hospitalization due to [respiratory infection] and sepsis.” Similarly, a study carried out in Brazil found an association between BCG immunization and a reduced risk of pneumonia mortality in children. It is still not clear exactly how and why these so-called heterologous effects of the BCG vaccine occur. However, it appears to be due to a nonspecific boosting of the immune response",

Gathering evidence as this pandemic unfolds will be very important, while upholding the norms of professional conduct and patient confidentiality when handling clinical details. Does the BCG vaccine protect people from COVID-19? There is no evidence at this point that the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. Clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend reserving BCG for neonatal vaccination in settings with a high risk of tuberculosis.

These effects have not been well characterized and their clinical relevance is unknown. 2,3 On 11 April 2020, WHO updated its ongoing evidence review of the major scientific databases and clinical trial repositories, using English, French and Chinese search terms for COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and BCG. The review yielded three preprints (manuscripts posted online before peer-review), in which the authors compared the incidence of COVID-19 cases in countries where the BCG vaccine is used with countries where it is not used and observed that countries that routinely used the vaccine in neonates had less reported cases of COVID-19 to date. Such ecological studies are prone to significant bias from many confounders, including differences in national demographics and disease burden, testing rates for COVID-19 virus infections, and the stage of the pandemic in each country. The review also yielded two registered protocols for clinical trials, both of which aim to study the effects of BCG vaccination given to health care workers directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19. 4,5 BCG vaccination prevents severe forms of tuberculosis in children and diversion of local supplies may result in neonates not being vaccinated, resulting in an increase of disease and deaths from tuberculosis. 6-8 In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19",

A bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis is what causes TB. The BCG vaccine reduces the chances of the bacterium infecting someone. It also reduces the severity of the disease in those who do contract it. The BCG vaccine first became available in 1921, and it appears on the World Health Organization (WHO) List of Essential Medicines. In excess of 100 million babies receive the BCG vaccination each year. Aside from TB, the BCG vaccine also protects against other conditions that involve mycobacterium, including leprosy. Scientists produce the vaccine using live Mycobacterium bovis taken from bovines, which they have attenuated to reduce their virility. Why might BCG work against COVID-19? Researchers are keen to investigate the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 because earlier work has shown that it might reduce the risk of some respiratory infections that are entirely unrelated to TB. For instance, a study that scientists conducted in Guinea-Bissau concluded that “BCG vaccination may have a nontargeted protective effect against [acute lower respiratory tract infection], the effect being most marked in girls.” In another study , researchers delved into retrospective data from Spanish hospitals. They concluded that “BCG vaccination at birth may decrease hospitalization due to [respiratory infection] and sepsis.” Similarly, a study carried out in Brazil found an association between BCG immunization and a reduced risk of pneumonia mortality in children. It is still not clear exactly how and why these so-called heterologous effects of the BCG vaccine occur. However, it appears to be due to a nonspecific boosting of the immune response",
